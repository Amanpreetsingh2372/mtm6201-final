Development Process
1. Wireframes → HighFidelity Designs → Code  
   I began with mobilefirst wireframes, ensuring accessibility and hierarchy, then translated them into full designs and responsive Bootstrap layouts.

2. ComponentBased Structure  
   Cards, buttons, and sections were designed to be consistent across pages for a unified visual system.

3. Styling & Theming  
   Custom CSS variables allow brandwide color updates. Bootstrap defaults were lightly overridden instead of rewritten for maintainability.



 Challenges & Solutions
 Ensuring strong accessibility: Bootstrap components required additional ARIA labels and keyboard testing. I added skip links, focus rings, and tested interactive elements without a mouse.
 Creating a calm, wellnessaligned design: The challenge was to balance visual calmness with readability. I selected a soft palette and highcontrast text to satisfy WCAG guidelines.
 Making audio content responsive: Audio players were tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Responsive container classes ensured proper scaling.
